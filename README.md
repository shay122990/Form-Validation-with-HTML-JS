# Form Validation with JS

## About The Project
This is a frontend sign up/register form validation project. We have different types of input fields and if some or none is complete you'll get a warning indication to fill in the required inputs. This also applies to the password input. Incase your password confirmation password in not matched, you won't be able to register. <br/>
The email field will need to have the "@" character. Website url field will need to have "url" format. A password will require 8 characters, one capital letter and one number.<br/>
Once all the fields are filled in and validated with an indication of green outline, you'll be able to register. A message at the bottom will display 'Successfully Registered', else it will display a message that requires the correct input.<br/>
This project is intended for anyone who wants to learn the methods applied with vanilla JavaScript. Once again, this is a frontend UI, so in the real world you'll be sending your object to your preferred DB.
